The program is supposed to calculate the sum of  distance between three points from each other.
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
   float x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3;
	cin >> x1 >> x2>>y1>>y2>>x3>>y3;

	float firstDiff = sqrt(pow(x2 - x1, 2) + pow(y2 - y1, 2));
	float secondDiff = sqrt(pow(x3 - x2, 2) + pow(y3 - y2, 2));
	float thirdDiff = sqrt(pow(x3 - x1, 2) + pow(y3 - y1, 2));

	cout << firstDiff + secondDiff + thirdDiff;
}
